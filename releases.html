        Various minor improvements. If you have opened an issue on GitHub, please check if it has been resolved.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.1.1 (Nov/26/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        1. A bug in the net meter on Big Sur was fixed, where it sometimes showed 0 bytes/sec unless the menu was brought up by clicking it.<br>
        2. Started preliminary Apple Silicon support. If the app crashes, please open it in Rosetta.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.1.0 (Nov/23/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        The order of various meters are correctly preserved across the launch on Big Sur.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.9 (Nov/14/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        You can finally choose colors with transparency.
        The auto-updater now sends basic system info such as the macOS version, the CPU type, etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.8.3 (Nov/2/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixed a serious bug in 2.0.8 where the app does not correctly work when the menubar is in the auto-hide mode.
        Unfortunately the autoupdater itself is not working for those affected by this bug.
        I am sorry about the mess, and I thank many people who reported the issue.
        (2.0.8.2 was a partial update which made things actually worse.)
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.8.1 (Oct/30/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        1. Fixed a bug in 2.0.8 on the dark mode support for pre-Mojave Macs.<br>
        2. Activity monitor panes are now selected correctly with Macs with discrete GPUs.<br>
        3. Forgot to say that 2.0.8 includes a new German localization thanks to <a href="https://github.com/schwedenmut">schwedenmut</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.8 (Oct/28/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        1. You can now tint the colors toward black/white depending on whether the system is in the light/dark mode, using a slider.<br>
        2. Activity Monitor can now be opened from any MenuMeter.<br>
        3. Many other bug fixes.<br>
        4. Probably with new bugs, due to my ongoing rewrite of the internals toward Big Sur.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.7 (May/21/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        CPU display modes are now configured in a saner way. You can now only show the CPU temperature, or even just a static label.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.6.1 (May/3/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        This update contains the dark mode fix I intended to include in 2.0.6. (The original 2.0.6 actually made things worse due to my stupid last minute change.)
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.6 (May/3/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Due to popular demand, you can now choose the interval to check the update. Also includes a fix for a dark mode bug.
